The purpose of this assignment was to teach us the fundementals of how to create a simple game using the culmination of our knowledge of sprites, animation, and 2D physics. Thisis a essentially a very dumbed-down version of the ancient arcade machine Galaga. Throught the creation of this assignment I have learned in further depth how to make sprites collide with each other, how to create a scoring system, and how to make sprites dissapear according to the input of the game.
